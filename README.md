# **Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets using Long Short-term Memory Networks**

#### Kate Pendavinji

This mini-project aims to utilize natural language processing  to automate text based disaster detection based on tweets. The tweets were retrieved from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview) which sourced them from [here](https://www.appen.com/data-for-everyone). The goal is to binarily classify disasters as real or not based on context from the text derived from natural language processing (NLP).

Natural language processing will be used to preprocess the text from our training data. We will perform actions such as removing stop words, normalizing the text, removing punctuation, and tokenizing the text. The NLP process also includes feature extraction which we will play around with. 

Then this project will use long short-term memory recurrent neural networks to train and test the given data. This will provide a predictive model that achieves the goal of automating the classification of tweets about disasters while improving accuracy and reliability.
